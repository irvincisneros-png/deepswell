// DeepSwell – Seagrass meadows & mangroves content (Moreton Bay, Queensland)
// Data only. Australian English. IUCN statuses checked October 2026.
// Notes for teachers:
//  - Green turtle: IUCN global status changed from Endangered to Least Concern in Oct 2025;
//    it remains listed as Vulnerable in Australia under the EPBC Act.
//  - Dugong: Vulnerable globally (IUCN); some overseas subpopulations (East Africa, Japan's Nansei
//    Islands) are Critically Endangered and New Caledonia's is Endangered. Vulnerable under
//    Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992.
//  - White's seahorse: Hippocampus procerus (Queensland) was merged into H. whitei in 2019, so
//    Moreton Bay sits within its range (Hervey Bay, Qld to Lake Illawarra, NSW).
//  - Whitespotted eagle ray: uplisted to Endangered in the most recent IUCN assessment
//    (older sources say Vulnerable).
//  - Mourning cuttlefish: now placed in the genus Ascarosepion (formerly Sepia plangon).
//  - Spotted sea hare: Indo-Pacific animals once called Aplysia dactylomela are now
//    Aplysia argus (Alexander & Valdés 2013).
//  - Zostera muelleri includes the plant formerly called Zostera capricorni.
//  - NSW link: Posidonia australis (strapweed) is listed as an endangered population in six
//    NSW estuaries (Port Hacking, Botany Bay, Sydney Harbour, Pittwater, Brisbane Water,
//    Lake Macquarie) under the Fisheries Management Act 1994.
